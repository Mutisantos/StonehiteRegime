The fire of the Creation Flame will keep burning
as long as Inti, our sun in the skies, 
keeps shining above us

<<002:Terreno d/003:Pajaro4/Page 01/001>>
The dance of flames will mantain Tatama's 
light alive forever.

<<002:Terreno d/005:Mono 1/Page 01/001>>
The flames are daughters of Inti, both they and
Kusikuy are the pillars of our civilization
by giving us light and knowledge. At the end of
our days, we will all return to those flames.

<<002:Terreno d/006:Mono 3/Page 01/001>>
The water mirrors let us see the magnificent
reflection of the sun in the day, and that

\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] Alright my child, before
anything, I hand you this ceremonial blowgun, 
it will catalyst for your flames that will light 
the bonfire that will tell your vocation.

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/004>>

You got a Blowgun!.

\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] Using the \C[16]A
\C[0] key you can channel your inner flames
and pass them through the blowgun, lighting
the ceremonial bonfire.

\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0] Creation Flame, here is one

with your gifts and may my actions be part of the 
Kusikuy and Tatama's spiderweb of knowledge

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/007>>
\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] Mi child, that's no the \C[16]A\C[0] Key

\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] What? and ordinary flame?
Why the fire remains red?

\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0] Well... isn't it the expected color?

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/010>>

\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] Not for this ritual, as you know.
A green light is for shamans and spiritual guides;
Yellow for mining, agriculture and economic activities;
Blue for warriors and the arts of combat.

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/011>>
<<position: top>>
\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] Even the purple flames for 
the royal dinasty, including the empress Inkukumi.
But to shine in this manner makes no sense...

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/012>>

\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] I have been the shaman leader
of Tatama for several year, and in spite of that, 
every new thing surpasses my knowledge.

during the rite?

\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0]No, I haven't noticed any anomaly,
if that was the case, the bonfires wouldn't even lighten.
Seems the kind of thing that only our guardian, Kusikuy,
would know.

\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0]Kusikuy? But only shamans and 
highly qualified warrios can have an audience with
him!

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/016>>

\C[1]???:\C[0] Seems like I will have to intervene here... 

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/017>>

<<position: top>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0]No need for presentations, that's not
the important thing here.

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/019>>

\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] Flamrose, you must demonstrate me
your worth for our people and gods. So, for you 
to do that...

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/020>>
<<position: top>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] you must go to depths of the 
fog forest and bring me a \C[16]Scorpion Fruit\C[0]
If you bring it to me, you will have your audience
with Kusikuy

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/021>>
<<position: top>>
\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] But the Fog Forest is 
a dangerous place for someone without training!

<<face: flamarosa, 0>>

\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0]It doesn't matter, I'll 
fight my way through so I can demonstrate what 
I'm capable of.

<<002:Terreno d/007:Flancoros/Page 02/023>>
<<position: top>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] That's the attitude!

follow Tzimitl

You got some Hard Breads

\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0]In -items- you can read the details

\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0]Special is where you can read
about the details of your battle skills, you 
will understand it soon. 

<<002:Terreno d/012:TZIMITL/Page 02/007>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0]Equipment is where you wear 
weapons, armors and accesories so you can 
be more efficient in combat.

<<002:Terreno d/012:TZIMITL/Page 02/008>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0]Later you we can talk about
the formation.

<<002:Terreno d/012:TZIMITL/Page 02/009>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0]Well, no more talking, follow me

<<002:Terreno d/015:TZIMITL/Page 01/001>>
We must keep the Creation Flame with the same 
dedication we have for Kusikuy. Our guardians are
everything that defines us as people of Tatama.

\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] For the love of Tatama, Flamrose,
the fact I'm the main shaman of our people won't make
you save you from your duties, and that includes our rituals.

<<003:Flamrose /001:EV001/Page 01/006>>
\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] And you already know that this 
one is the most important of them. Today, the great flame of

<<003:Flamrose /001:EV001/Page 01/007>>

\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0] I know, I know, it's just that
I got anxious and didn't go to sleep early for that,
so I end up waking up late... hehehe...

<<003:Flamrose /001:EV001/Page 01/008>>
\C[2]Flancorose:\C[0] Well, I'll wait you outside,
get ready and then follow me to the holy grounds.

<<003:Flamrose /001:EV001/Page 01/009>>

their posts and surveillance tasks around
Tatama

<<004:Poblado S/012:TZIMITL/Page 01/002>>

\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0]That being the case, I guess 
that you can have your way to the Fog Forest 
now. Good luck Flamrose.

<<004:Poblado S/012:TZIMITL/Page 01/003>>

\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] But before leaving, let me 
treat your wounds, I'm known for being demanding

talk with my soldiers that are practicing them.
Rehearse them if you want.

\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] I'll remain here waiting for

\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] Flamrose, Why did you unequip your
blowgun and your auxiliar knife? They are fundamental
for fighting and surviving. Let me fix that.

<<004:Poblado S/014:Bichotuto/Page 01/002>>
<<position: top>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] Be careful, if you unequip your 
weapons and armors you will be more vulnerable and 
certain skills won't be able to be executed. 
Be extremely careful with that!

<<004:Poblado S/014:Bichotuto/Page 01/003>>
<<position: top>>
\C[1]Tzimitl:\C[0] Okay, before entering combat,
Do you remember everything related to combat flow,
synched attacks and special skills?

<<004:Poblado S/014:Bichotuto/Page 01/004>>
Of course I do!

Whew, finally, some help arrived. We tried to send 
runners from Uhl, but it has been impossible with 
all of these weird metallic blocks and that 
witchcraft that transforms anything into monsters...

<<009:Bosque de/043:Dodotutor/Page 01/002>>
In my current state, I can only give you some advice 
to get into the Lunar Temple, as there are several 
security controls between Tatama and Uhl.

<<009:Bosque de/043:Dodotutor/Page 01/003>>
As you might know, there are \C[2]those who can summon flames
\C[0], but there are other talents such as \C[23] those
who can shot and activate switches from afar \C[0] or 
even \C[10] those who can summon water.\C[0]

<<009:Bosque de/043:Dodotutor/Page 01/004>>
If you press either \C[16]Q\C[0] or \C[16]W\C[0] you can swap
who is the first in the line, so they can show their 
particular talent and activate switches or remove
obstacles. Give it a try!

<<009:Bosque de/043:Dodotutor/Page 01/005>>
Perfect. Now you can get through, remember that 
every talent can be shown pressing the \C[16]A\C[0]
key as the girl from Tatama has already done. 

<<009:Bosque de/043:Dodotutor/Page 01/006>>
No, not that one, I said either \C[16]Q\C[0] o \C[16]W\C[0]

<<009:Bosque de/047:EV047/Page 01/001>>

can sell you some items from here.

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/006>>
\c[8]Kusikuy:\c[0]The Tatama spiderweb of knowledge 
has a tale even older that our domains were founded.
\. A tale about a threat that came out of nowhere,
attacking every river and coast in the world. 

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/007>>
\c[5]Inkukumi:\c[0] The tale is so old that the contents 
are blurry, but it's said that monsters came to 
desolate every town, territory and civilization 
in the planet. That until the Guardians gave us

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/008>>
their powers to restore the peace and control and recover
our freedom from those monsters.

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/009>>
\c[8]Kusikuy:\c[0] If the great Creation Flame, the origin 
of the light and knowledge of Tatama has produced a 
flame of the most natural color, it only mean that it has 
given it's power as it detected a new threat.

\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0] Wait, Pengralle, do you think that all 
of this could be related to the enemies you were 
investigating and that attacked you?

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/011>>
<<face: FPengralle, 5>>
\C[23]Pengralle\C[0]: I guess this information is no 
longer classified. \.We are tracking a dangerous 
criminal that has shown a technological firepower 
completely unknown to our era.


<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/012>>
\c[5]Inkukumi:\c[0] What do you think, Flamrose?
Both things seem to be related.

\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0] Empress, it's just a wild guess, 
but so many things happening at the same time 
cannot be a mere coincidence. 

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/014>>
<<face: flamarosa, 0>>
\C[2]Flamrose:\C[0] We must keep researching, to find 
what is behind all of this and stop whoever who 
wants to harm our people.

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/015>>
\c[8]Kusikuy:\c[0]I have no doubts why you are 
the chosen one by the flame and to be the new 
Tatama's Warrior.

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/016>>
\c[5]Inkukumi:\c[0] Sadly, we have no clear information, 
but I bet that if the details are not present in the 
Solar Temple, then should be on the Lunar Temple at 
the Uhl village. 

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/017>>
\c[8]Kusikuy:\c[0] The quipus and the memories of 
the flames there could have the details that are 
missing in this tale. That way, we can be better 
prepared for any scenario.

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/018>>
\c[8]Kusikuy:\c[0] But, before leaving, come here, 
I must give you one of the definitive powers from 
the Guardians of Tatama, only reserved to the 
royalty. 

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/019>>
\c[8]Kusikuy:\c[0] This is called \c[2]Ancient Trace\c[0],
this skill will let you access Tatama's spiderweb 
of knowledge. It makes possible to read the 
strengths and weaknesses of your foes.

<<011:Templo So/010:EV010/Page 01/020>>

We reiterate: It has been confirmed a new incursion 
of the Re-Evolutionary Army of Stonehite. Let's 
see the details.

<<024:CronicTv/009:Capitulo /Page 01/003>>
Indeed. According to a report from the Star Center
 for Special Operations, a new operation by the army 
 of the self-proclaimed General Stonehite has 
 hit the Tatama region.

<<024:CronicTv/009:Capitulo /Page 01/004>>
Oh, that's terrible, poor people of Tatamales!

<<024:CronicTv/009:Capitulo /Page 01/005>>
Don't be an idiot. It's the Tatama Domain, 
located on the northern edge of Cobeltian 
Continent. It seems like I'll have to 
show you with a map.

<<024:CronicTv/009:Capitulo /Page 01/006>>
The continent on the left is Cobeltia, we are 
on the right side, in the Eosian Continent. 
Now, let's zoom a little bit more.

<<024:CronicTv/009:Capitulo /Page 01/007>>
This place is a really complex place to reach,
so their contact with the rest of the world 
have been quite limited, even with the nearest
regions.

<<024:CronicTv/009:Capitulo /Page 01/008>>
It's a place so beautiful... and unknown!

\C[11]Kovurumbe:\C[0] Youngsters from the far lands, 
if you talk with the young raccoon, give him 
my regards.

<<036:Poblado G/009:Kovurumbe/Page 02/001>>
\C[11]Kovurumbe:\C[0] Hurry up to go to Frocteres. 
But be warned that walking through the desert is 
complicated. Even if I were wandering around it,
I would certainly get lost.

<<036:Poblado G/014: /Page 01/001>>
Earth magic is pretty diverse. You can use your 
magical energy to raise plants to live, or use 
your rage to make the ground tremble.

<<036:Poblado G/015: /Page 01/001>>
Guacarí's phylosophy remains in a constant relation 
between steadiness and movement. Between silence 
and noise, between dance and meditation, between
rivers and dunes.

<<036:Poblado G/016: /Page 01/001>>
Trying to keep the pace of Kovurumbe magic teachings 
is pretty exhausting, but we must keep pushing 
forward to become warriors worthy of his gifts.

\C[11]Kovurumbe:\C[0] young raccoon, calm down, if they

\C[11]Kovurumbe:\C[0] Well, where do I start?
\!Oh, right, from the beginning. A long time ago 
I have been perceiving an huge amount of 
weirding energy from far beyond the desert. 

<<036:Poblado G/012:EV012/Page 02/006>>
\C[11]Kovurumbe:\C[0] And just a few days ago I 
detected that kind of energy getting closer and closer 
to our domains. I lost the track of it when it 
reached the Zone of Silence. 

<<036:Poblado G/012:EV012/Page 02/007>>
\C[16]Tambuku:\C[0] We sent a team of runners to there 
and we found the three of them wandering and unable 
to contact their allies. Unlike others, they have 
shown no animosity against any of us.

<<036:Poblado G/012:EV012/Page 02/008>>
\C[16]Tambuku:\C[0]Eventually, they gave us context

Kovurumbe can sense the energy of living beings 
and know when they get closer. However, these 
things that attacked us were able to pass 
unadverted even with his power.
